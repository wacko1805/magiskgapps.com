# MagiskGApps Maker Beta
## Original MagiskGApps will be replaced by the MagiskGApps Maker (MGM). Pre-made varients will not be updated!
MagiskGApps maker is an online tool to generate MagiskGApps packages from regular GApps files.
# Supported GApps Packages:
- NikGApps
- MindTheGApps
- Please recommend other GApps packages in the issues tab!
# To Do:
- Add support for more GApps types. (please reccomend other popular options!)
- Create a custom module.prop and install files using the original file names
- potentially create an app to flash directly
## Known Issues:
- Will process zip through both NikGApps and MindTheGApps files if one radio button is selected, and then the other, causeing timeout error
- NikGApps script leaves all files not needed for MagiskGApps functionality in the zip file
